  React is a DOM manipulation library. It contains methods that allow us to create virtual DOM nodes, then render them to the real DOM so they appear on our web page.

  A minimal React HTML page looks like this:


  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <body>
      <div id="app"></div>

      <script src="lib/react.js"></script>
      <script src="lib/react-dom.js"></script>
      <script src="app/app.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  We havea div with an id of app, then we have three script tags, two of which belong to React, and one of which (`app.js`) contains our code.


  ## Creating virtual DOM nodes

  To use React, we create virtual DOM nodes, like so:

  ```
  React.createElement('h1', null, "Hello, world!");
  ```

  The parameters are:

  1. The type of element we want.
  2. A JSON object which will be used to make attributes.
  3. The content of the element. This might be an array of other elements.


  ## Rendering

  Creating this DOM node does nothing, because so far we have only maipulated the *Virtual DOM*.

  If we want to take these changes and slap them onto the real DOM, we have to 'render'. We do this using ReactDOM.

  ```
  // First make the virtual DOM node
  React.createElement('h1', null, "Hello, world!");

  // Next choose a real DOM node to act as the root
  var root = document.getElementById('app');

  // Now render
  ReactDOM.render(h1, root);
  ```

  Run this code to make a hello world. Now that was pretty simple right?


  ## Helper methods

  Typing React.createElement all the time is going to get stale quite quickly. react gives us helper methods for common html DOM nodes. Say we want an h1, we can call:

  ```
  React.DOM.h1(null, "Hello, world!");

  // this is fully equivalent to:

  React.createElement('h1', null, "Hello, world!");
  ```

    ## Exercise - Hello React

    In this exercise, we're just going to get some React running in a browser.

    Download the React starting point from the github repo. Now try to get it running in a browser.

    Change the code to put the message "goodbye cruel world" in a footer tag.

    For bonus points, try to add a title attribute.
