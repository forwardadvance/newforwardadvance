    We can use Webpack to modularise our Angular 2 code.

    There are quite a lot of dependencies. We can get them from NPM. Create a package.json file and put the following in it:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "webpack_demo",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {},
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "devDependencies": {
        "@angular/common":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/compiler":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/core":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/http":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/platform-browser":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/router":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/router-deprecated":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "@angular/upgrade":  "2.0.0-rc.1",
        "systemjs": "0.19.27",
        "core-js": "^2.4.0",
        "reflect-metadata": "^0.1.3",
        "rxjs": "5.0.0-beta.6",
        "zone.js": "^0.6.12"
      }
    }
    ```

    Now npm install to get them all.

    We can now make use of the dependencies in our code.

    in build/app.js, do something like this:

    ```
    require('reflect-metadata');
    require('rxjs');
    require('zone.js');
    var platform = require('@angular/platform-browser-dynamic');
    var AppComponent = require('./app.component')

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      platform.bootstrap(AppComponent);
    });
    ```

    Now we need to create the component. Make a file called source/app.component.js and put the following into it:

    ```
    var core = require('@angular/core');

    module.exports = core.Component({
      selector: "app",
      template:
      `
        Hello Webpack!
      `
    })
    .Class({
      constructor: function() {
        this.isHidden = true;
        this.x = 'test';
        this.color = 'blue';
      }
    })
    ```

    Build with webpack.

    Now we just need some html:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title></title>
        <script src="build/build.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <app></app>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    Notice that the only script dependency is app.js. This is because we are requiring everything else into app.js.
