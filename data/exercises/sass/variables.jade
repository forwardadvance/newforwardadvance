    We can define variables in SASS using a dollar, like so:

    ```
    $gutter: 100px;
    ```

    We can then make use of this standard variable anywhere we like:

    ```css
    header {
      margin: $gutter;
      padding: $gutter;
    }
    ```

    ## Colours

    This is very useful for hex codes. We can share standard colours across an application.

    If we have CSS like this:

    ```scss
    a {
      color:#f00;
    }
    ```

    We can write this:

    ```scss
    $red: #f00;
    a {
      color:$red;
    }
    ```

    We might later change the value of $red:

    ```scss
    $red: #dd4455;
    ```

    Wherever we have used $red in our application, this hex code will be changed.

    ## A bank of colours

    We might create a set of standard colours, and reuse them. We can then create variables to represent certain common parts of our application, like dialog backgrounds or keylines:

    ```scss
    $dark_grey: #444;
    $light_grey: #bbb;

    $keyline_color: $light_grey;

    header {
      border-bottom: 1px solid $keyline_color;
    }
    sidebar {
      border-right: 1px solid $keyline_color;
    }
    ```

    ## Exercise - Colours and padding

    Download the exercise start point. You'll find an HTML file with a header an article, and a footer.

    Add common margins and padding on the header, article and footer.

    Create a dark grey colour for the body text, and a slightly lighter grey colour for the headings.

    Create a $desktop_width variable:

    ```scss
    $desktop_width: 1000px;
    ```

    Set a max-width on the body, so the content will stretch to 1000px, then stop.
