<h1>View Events</h1>

<p>DOM events are different from BackBone events. Backbone has it&rsquo;s own events handling mechanism but events fired by the DOM are usually handled by jQuery.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>Create a view that adds a form to the page containing an input element and a button. Use the events attribute to add a listener such that on submit the value in the input element is alerted to the screen.</p>

<p>Use $(&lsquo;input&rsquo;).value() to get the value of the input.</p>

<p>Remember you will need to call event.preventDefault() in your handler.</p>

<h2>Extension</h2>

<p>Add more than one form to the page. Be as clever as you like about this.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>Check out View delegateEvents. This is the method that handles your events object.</p>
