    # Dependency Injection

    We can inject a dependency into a controller by simply receiving it.

    ```
    angular.module('demoModule', [])
      .controller('demoController', function($log) {
        $log.log('Hi!');
      }
    ```html

  :markdown

    ## Modules

    We can include a module into another module by placing it's name between the square braces:

    ```
    angular.module('app', ['demoModule']);
    ```html

    ## Exercise - NgDialog

    We are going to inject the ngDialog service into a controller. This will allow our controller to create popup dialog boxes.

    First go here and grab the ng-dialog.js. Link it in the header of your document in the usual way with a script tag.

    Now download the CSS files: ng-dialog.css and ng-dialog-theme-plain.css. Link them using link tags.

    <http://ngmodules.org/modules/ngDialog>

    ## Include it in your app.

    We need to include ngDialog as a dependency of the app, like this:

    ```
    angular.module('app', ['ngDialog'])
    ```html

  :markdown

    ## Inject into your controller.

    Create a little controller and use the ng-controller directive to hook it to the DOM.

    ```
    <div ng-controller="myController">
    ```html

  :markdown

    Inject the ngDialog service into your controller.

    ```
    .controller('myController', function($scope, ngDialog) {

    })
    ```html

  :markdown

    You now have access to ngDialog.open. Call this according to the documentation to create a dialog box when the page loads: <https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#api>

    e.g.

    ```
    ngDialog.open({
      template: '<p>my template</p>',
      className: 'ngdialog-theme-plain',
      plain: true
    });
    ```html

    ## Exercise - Extension

    Create a form. Create a method on scope that opens the dialog. Call the method when the button is pressed.

    Have a go at the minification safe DI syntax.

    ## Further extension

    If you finish first, have a read through the DI documentation here:

    <https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di>
