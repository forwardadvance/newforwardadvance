    In the previous sections we looked at input and output with our Angular 2 components

    * Input: via attributes and properties
    * Output: via events which we can listen to

    This means we can now interact with forms.

    An &lt;input /> DOM node will emit many different events when our user interacts with it, including:

    * keyup - when the user presses a key
    * focus - When the user enters the field
    * blur - When the user leaves the field
    * input - When the value property changes

    We can bind to any of these and have our update events fire when the event is triggered.

    ## The input event

    The most interesting of these is the input event. This fires whenever the value attribute changes. Let's save the value in the catName attribute of the component:

    ```html
    <input (input)="catName=$event.target.value" />
    ```

    ## Two way binding

    We might want to set the value of catName based on the component. We can do this in our template by binding the value property, like so:

    ```html
    <input [value]="catName" />
    ```

    Put it together and you have two way binding:


    ```html
    <input [value]="catName" (input)="catName=$event.target.value" />
    ```


    ## NgModel

    This is such a common thing to want to do that Angular gives us a shorthand.

    NgModel is a directive. We haven't seen any directives yet. A directive is just a component which doesn't have it's own template. Instead it modifies the template of the component or element it is applied to.

    The NgModel directive creates all of this data binding for us. It will bind a value and add an input listener.

    ```html
    <input [(ngModel)]='catName' />
    ```

    Notice the [()] brace combo. This shows that we are binding a property, to the return value of the event listener. It's a two way binding.

    ## Binding to submit

    We can bind to the (submit) event of a form to have something happen when we submit. This is better than binding to the (click) event of the button, because there are ways to submit a form other than clicking the button, for example the user might press enter on an input element.

    ```html
    <form (submit)="onSubmit()">
      <button>Go!</button>
    </form>
    ```

    If we have used ngInput to bind our inputs, we can then use this data to update a model.

    ## Exercise - Create an edit user form

    Create an app containing a user profile component, and a user profile edit component. Make it so that when you edit the user profile, the data is passed back up to the app component via an event, and then back down into the user profile display component.

//-     ## Exercise - Download Tagged Content from Flickr

//-     In your exercise folder you'll find a piece of code that can download a Flickr feed and display it in a web page. This is currently hardcoded, so it can only show sheep.

//-     Create an input element and bind it to the controller, such that when you type in it, the value is updated. Now make it so that when you click a button, it goes and downloads the feed for that tag.
